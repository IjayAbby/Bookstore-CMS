# Bookstore Project

In this project, I set up a clone of the Bookstore_CMS. It consists of  two sections BOOKS and CATEGORIES (styles and functionality with REACT and Tailwindcss). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## :hammer: Built With

- REACT and REDUX.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/IjayAbby/Bookstore-CMS).
2. Press the "Code" button and copy the link.
3. Clone it using git command `git clone <link>`.
4. Run `npm install` to install the packages and dependencies.

## :blue_book: Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of state management.
- Use store, actions and reducers in React.
- Connect React and Redux.
